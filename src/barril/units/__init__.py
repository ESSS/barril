B{Unit Management}

It is very common within an application (especially on engineering applications) to have
several different values within the application, regarding pressure, density, etc. But just
having the values without any scope is something that can be meaningless, as that value only
makes sense if we have a unit and we know what it relates to.

This module is designed to help the application manage those values and units, based on the
following B{requisites}:

  - changing all the units in the application that relate to something to a different unit
    (e.g.: all the units that relate to the well height that are currently in the application
    as meters should be treated with km from now on).
  - being able to easily change the unit on some entity and have its value updated (in python)
  - getting all the created elements that have some kind of measure, such as length or depth.
  - having the info on C++ is a requisite, but the automatic conversion utilities are not, as C++
    is used for hardcore processing, this is usually done manually (as a generic way would waste
    too much processing), so, basically, the structure in C++ is important, but things related to
    the application management are not.
  - have a default way of managing those values within the application, and giving default
    implementations for it (such as Scalars, Arrays)
  - being able to define the units that can be used for some category

Usage:

    >>> from barril import units
    >>> from barril.units import scalar
    >>>
    >>> unit_manager = units.UnitDatabase()
    >>> unit_manager.AddUnitBase('length', 'meters', 'm')
    >>> unit_manager.AddUnit('length', 'milimeters', 'mm', 'x * 1000.0', 'x / 1000.0')
    >>> unit_manager.AddUnit('length', 'centimeters', 'cm', 'x * 100.0', 'x / 100.0')
    >>> unit_manager.AddCategory('well-diameter', 'length')
    >>> s = scalar.Scalar.Create('well-diameter', 10, 'm', unit_manager)
    >>> repr(s)
    "'Scalar'('length', 10, 'm')"
    >>> print s.value
    10
    >>> print s.unit
    m
    >>> s.GetCategory()
    'well-diameter'
    >>> s.GetQuantityType()
    'length'
    >>> s.unit = 'cm'
    >>> repr(s)
    "'Scalar'('length', 1000.0, 'cm')"
    >>> print s
    1000.00 centimeters
    >>> print s.GetValue(unit='mm')
    10000.0


B{Design decisions}:

    - In order to make the validation of categories, quantity types and units, the unit-manager
    must be passed around when the objects are created and a weakref is kept for future changes.

    - It is not all 'static' as it was before because this would hinder some applications, especially
    applications with multiple documents, as those applications may need multiple unit-managers
    (one for each open document).

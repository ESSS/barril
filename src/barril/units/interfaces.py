"""
Barril basic interfaces are defined here.

Basic concepts used in the interfaces:

Category: Identifies the category for some value. This is defined in the application level. E.g.:
    Well length, Well diameter.

QuantityType: The type of the quantity we're interested in. E.g.: length, depth (this was previously
    defined as Measure, but with different meanings among applications, so, the name Measure has been
    'deprecated' in the favor of this one, so that old-habits about it are not continued -- and it is also
    referenced in posc).

Unit: the unit itself. E.g.: m, m/s, kg

Note: The naming conventions were gathered from posc:
    http://www.posc.org/ebiz/pefxml/patternsobjects.html http://www.posc.org/refs/poscUnits20.xml

class IQuantity2(Interface):
    """
    Optional interface to the IQuantity used to deal with operations dealing with different
    units which result in derived units.

    With that in mind, this interface defines that all the information (category, quantity type and
    unit) may be dicts instead of only strings, where a dict is a string that points to a given
    expoent.

    In this way, a unit defined as m2/s would be a dict: {'m':2, 's':-1} that is later used to
    do operations.

    This return type is shared for all the 'Gets' defined in this interface

    Quantities that do not define this interface may not be used in operations that may result in
    a derived quantity.
